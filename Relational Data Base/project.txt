30215 - Project

Spec:	Lessons:	- "Unit 3 - Project" (online class only)
	Resources:	- "Module-3-pr"
			- "Module-3-pr-ERD" (available after due date of Part 1)

Timing:
By due date for Part 1:
	- ER Diagram and (if necessary) supporting text explaining the design.
	  Filename: ERD-<<yourname>> 
	  Acceptable formats: Word document, plain text, PDF, PNG, JPG
	  Any format that requires online access is NOT acceptable(e.g. Googledoc)
	  An ERD drawn on paper and submitted as a PDF, PNG, or JPG is acceptable
	  as long as I can read the writing.
By due date for Part 2:
	- Script file to initialize the database.
	  Put MySQL or SQLPlus in a comment line so I know which to use.
	  Filename: provision-<<yourname>>.sql
	  Acceptable format: plain text (SQLPlus/MySQL cannot interpret others)
	- Instruction file with example SQL commands.
	  Filename: query-<<yourname>>.sql 
	  Acceptable formats: plain text

Replace <<yourname>> with your first initial and your full last name as it is on
your registration. e.g. If I was registered as "Niket Patwardhan" I would 
replace <<yourname>> with NPatwardhan

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Part 1) Data Analysis - 14 points
Please submit an ER Diagram outlining your DB design and supporting text - 
i.e. why you did it that way.

This is an exercise in communication and interpretation skills. Some of the spec
is deliberately ambiguous, make sure the necessary questions to clear it up are
asked. It is perfectly fair to ask others if something was or was not said in 
the presentation, or to present some hypothesis of yours and have them support 
or knock it down; or to ask the "Manager" (i.e. the "Instructor Role") via 
Messages to clarify some point. What you may not do is look at or ask about the 
ER Diagram of others, or show or explain yours to others.

In your ERD I will be looking for essential entities, relationships between 
them, their attributes, and any constraints you have identified. I also will 
look for conformance to 3NF.

Part 2) SQL Implementation - 20 points
Please submit a plain text script file that creates the database as per 
Module-3-pr-ERD and loads any initial data you need to demonstrate your project 
works. You can assume the "classdb" schema exists and is empty when this file is
executed, and the user executing it is "classdb". Also submit another file that
contains example SQL commands that will produce the information requested or do
the updates specified on the page titled "Queries/Reports" in Module-3-pr-ERD. 
Please call them provision-<<yourname>>.sql and query-<<yourname>>.sql

SQLPlus - assume script will be run by user "classdb"
MySQL - assume script will be run by user "rdb30215" in database "classdb"

Queries will be run by the user/s you specify in the instruction file. If not 
specified, they will be run by "classdb". 

You could get 0/15 on this part of the project if the provisioning script file 
fails to complete successfully, so please make sure it works BEFORE you turn it
in. If it runs without errors producing a database that meets the "signed off" 
design specified in Module-3-pr-ERD you will get 5 points, and the remaining 15
points will be based on how well the queries meet the requirements. Upto 1 point
will be deducted from the 15 for each type of mistake. Multiple submissions will
cost you one point each after the first submission. 

Both MySQL and SQLPlus have some limitations that you will need to workaround
to implement all the constraints required by the ERD. If you used MySQL and can
not figure out how to implement a constraint, I may give partial credit for SQL
that shows how to achieve it in SQLPlus (and vice-versa).

Please make sure the files you submit are your own work, and that you do not
share your work. Any violation will result in a zero score.
